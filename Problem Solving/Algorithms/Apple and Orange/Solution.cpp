/*

Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. In the diagram below, the red region denotes his house, where s is the start point, and t is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of his house, and the orange tree is to its right. You can assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at point a, and the orange tree is at point b.

When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands d units of distance from its tree of origin along the x-axis. A negative value of d means the fruit fell d units to the tree's left, and a positive value of d means it falls d units to the tree's right.

Given the value of d for m apples and n oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range [s, t])?

For example, Sam's house is between s= 7 and t = 10. The apple tree is located at a = 4 and the orange at b = 12. There are m = 3 apples and n = 3 oranges. Apples are thrown apples = [2, 3, -4] units distance from a, and oranges = [3, -2, -4] units distance. Adding each apple distance to the position of the tree, they land at [4 + 2, 4 + 3, 4 + -4] = [6, 7, 0]. Oranges land at [12 + 3, 12 + -2, 12 + -4] = [15, 10, 8]. One apple and two oranges land in the inclusive range 7 - 10 so we print

Function Description

Complete the countApplesAndOranges function in the editor below. It should print the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house, each on a separate line.

countApplesAndOranges has the following parameter(s):

s: integer, starting point of Sam's house location.
t: integer, ending location of Sam's house location.
a: integer, location of the Apple tree.
b: integer, location of the Orange tree.
apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the tree.
oranges: integer array, distances at which each orange falls from the tree.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of s and t. 
The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of a and b. 
The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of m and n. 
The fourth line contains m space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each apple falls from point a. 
The fifth line contains n space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each orange falls from point b.

Constraints

1 <= s, t, a, b, m, n <= 10^5
-10^5 <= d <= 10^5
a < s < t < b

Output Format

Print two integers on two different lines:

1. The first integer: the number of apples that fall on Sam's house.
2. The second integer: the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.
