/*

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

when A = B and B = C then "Equilateral"
when A = B or A = C or B = C then "Isosceles"
else "Scalene"
